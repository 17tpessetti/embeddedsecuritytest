                    <p>Ryan M. Gerdes is an Associate Professor in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech.  Dr. Gerdes’ work focuses on designing resilient computing systems, with an emphasis on cyber-physical systems operating in adversarial environments and leveraging the physical layer for defensive and offensive purposes.  He is the principal investigator on NSF and DOE projects that examine the security and privacy of cooperative, automated vehicles; unmanned aerial systems (UAS); and next-generation battery electric vehicles and chargers.</p>
                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>This talk will consider attacks in three domains against safety critical systems: 1) in vision-based object classification systems imaging sensors perceive the environment and machine learning is then used to detect and classify objects for decision-making purposes; e.g., to maneuver an automated vehicle around an obstacle or to raise an alarm to indicate the presence of an intruder in surveillance settings. We will discuss how the perception domain can be remotely and unobtrusively exploited to enable an attacker to create spurious objects or alter an existing object. 2) Extremely fast charging (XFC), whereby electric vehicles (EV) can be quickly recharged in the time frame it takes to refuel an internal combustion engine, has been proposed to alleviate range anxiety in EVs.  A critical component of these chargers is the efficient and proper operation of power converters that convert AC to DC power and otherwise regulate power delivery to vehicles.  We will demonstrate that, with relatively low power levels, an adversary is able to manipulate the voltage and current sensor outputs necessary to ensure the proper operation of the converters, to catastrophic effect. 3) Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) are safety-critical systems required on most commercial aircrafts in service today. We'll examine TCAS from an adversarial perspective with the goal of inducing near mid-air collisions between current day TCAS-equipped aircraft.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>The mission of the Cybersecurity Assurance and Policy (CAP) Center at Morgan State University is to provide the defense and intelligence community with the knowledge, methodology, solutions, and highly skilled cybersecurity professionals to mitigate penetration and manipulation of our nation’s cyber- hysical infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) permeates all areas of life and work, with unprecedented economic effects. The IoT is a network of dedicated physical objects (things) whose embedded system technology senses or interacts with its internal state or external environment. Embedded systems perform dedicated functions within larger mechanical or electrical systems. Critical infrastructures in transportation, smart grid, manufacturing, and health care, etc. are highly dependent on embedded systems for distributed control, tracking, and data collection. While it is paramount to protect these systems from hacking, intrusion, and physical tampering, current solutions rely on a patchwork of legacy systems, and this is unsustainable as a long-term solution. Transformative solutions are required to protect these systems. In this talk, we will present our current research that addresses security vulnerabilities in IoT ecosystems to provide secure, resilient, and robust operation.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Perception plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems,which utilizes onboard sensors like cameras and LiDARs(Light Detection and Ranging) to assess surroundings. Recentstudies have demonstrated that LiDAR-based perception isvulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which adversaries spoof afake vehicle in front of a victim self-driving car by strategically transmitting laser signals to the victim’s LiDAR sensor. However, existing attacks suffer from effectiveness and generality limitations. In this work, we perform the first study toexplore the general vulnerability of current LiDAR-based perception architectures and discover that the ignored occlusionpatterns in LiDAR point clouds make self-driving cars vulnerable to spoofing attacks. We construct the first black-box spoofing attack based on our identified vulnerability, which universally achieves around 80% mean success rates on alltarget models. We perform the first defense study, proposingCARLO to mitigate LiDAR spoofing attacks. CARLO detectsspoofed data by treating ignored occlusion patterns as invari-ant physical features, which reduces the mean attack successrate to 5.5%. Meanwhile, we take the first step towards explor-ing a general architecture for robust LiDAR-based perception,and propose SVF that embeds the neglected physical featuresinto end-to-end learning. SVF further reduces the mean attacksuccess rate to around 2.3%.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Data privacy and cybersecurity should both be seriously considered for all devices that interact with our patients. Patient data privacy is a key tenet of HIPAA, but data acquired by devices outside the medical record may not be protected. Implanted neuromodulation devices for movement disorders, epilepsy, and pain are able to track and record data, which can then be downloaded to hospital, office or manufacturer sites for review. These data can be collected and stored indefinitely, allowing for retrospective analysis, which as our understanding of neurophysiology improves, will lead to new and unforeseen insights. For example, brainwave data collected for seizure mapping served as the basis for understanding neurophysiology of vision, ultimately contributing to developing of a new neuromodulation device to enable sight. What today might seem like unparsable noise may be the key to a breakthrough as our neuroscience knowledge and artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities improve. As with collection and recording from external devices, there are serious concerns about the privacy of date collected from implanted devices. There is little education of patients and clinicians about data collection and its use and possible misuse, and these considerations are rarely part of informed consent discussions. There is no business relationship between the patient and the manufacturer of their device, no statement of Terms of Service, nor discussion of how patients might opt out of data collection. Until policies are clearer, clinicians and patients must rely on the good will, morality or ethical code of manufacturers to preserve data privacy.</p>
