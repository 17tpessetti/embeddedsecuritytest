  abstract = {This work analyzes the stochastic behavior of
                  writing to embedded flash memory at voltages lower
                  than recommended by a microcontroller's
                  specifications to reduce energy consumption.  Flash
                  memory integrated within a microcontroller typically
                  requires the entire chip to operate on common supply
                  voltage almost double what the CPU portion requires.
                  Our approach tolerates a lower supply voltage so
                  that the CPU may operate in a more energy efficient
                  manner.  Energy efficient coding algorithms then
                  cope with flash memory that behaves unpredictably.
                  Our software-only coding algorithms (in-place
                  writes, multiple-place writes, RS-Berger codes)
                  enable reliable storage at low voltages on
                  unmodified hardware by exploiting the electrically
                  cumulative nature of half-written data in write-once
                  bits.  For a sensor monitoring application using the
                  MSP430, coding with in-place writes reduces the
                  overall energy consumption by 34\%.  In-place writes
                  are competitive when the time spent on computation
                  is at least four times greater than the time spent
                  on writes to flash memory.  Our evaluation shows
                  that tightly maintaining the digital abstraction for
                  storage in embedded flash memory comes at a
                  significant cost to energy consumption with minimal
                  gain in reliability.}
