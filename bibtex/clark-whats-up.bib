  abstract = {Embedded systems are ubiquitous, connect to networks, and
	increasingly use off-the-shelf operating systems vulnerable to malware. Yet,
	strict validation processes make it difficult or too costly to use anti-virus
	software or automated operating system updates in embedded systems such as
	medical devices. Our WattsUpDoc system uses a traditionally undesirable
	side channel of power consumption to enable run-time malware detection. Our
	measurements show that WattsUpDoc can detect previously known malware with at
	least 94% accuracy and previously unknown malware with at least 85% accuracy
	on the devices we tested. While the detection rates are similar to that of
	conventional malware-detection systems, WattsUpDoc requires no hardware or
	software modification or network communication.},
