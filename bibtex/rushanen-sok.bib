  abstract = {Balancing security, privacy, safety, and utility
                  is a necessity in the health care domain, in which
                  implantable medical devices (IMDs) and body area
                  networks (BANs) have made it possible to
                  continuously and automatically manage and treat a
                  number of health conditions.  In this work, we
                  survey publications aimed at improving security and
                  privacy in IMDs and health-related BANs, providing
                  clear definitions and a comprehensive overview of
                  the problem space. We analyze common themes,
                  categorize relevant results, and identify trends and
                  directions for future research. We present a visual
                  illustration of this analysis that shows the
                  progression of IMD/BAN research and highlights
                  emerging threats. We identify three broad research
                  categories aimed at ensuring the security and
                  privacy of the telemetry interface, software, and
                  sensor interface layers and discuss challenges
                  researchers face with respect to ensuring
                  reproducibility of results. We find that while the
                  security of the telemetry interface has received
                  much attention in academia, the threat of software
                  exploitation and the sensor interface layer deserve
                  further attention. In addition, we observe that
                  while the use of physiological values as a source of
                  entropy for cryptographic keys holds some promise, a
                  more rigorous assessment of the security and
                  practicality of these schemes is required.}
