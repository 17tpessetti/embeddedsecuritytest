  abstract = {Electromagnetic interference (EMI) affects
                  circuits by inducing voltages on conductors.  Analog
                  sensing of signals on the order of a few millivolts
                  is particularly sensitive to interference.  This
                  work (1) measures the susceptibility of analog
                  sensor systems to signal injection attacks by
                  intentional, low-power emission of chosen
                  electromagnetic waveforms, and (2) proposes defense
                  mechanisms to reduce the risks.  Our experiments use
                  specially crafted EMI at varying power and distance
                  to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable
                  medical devices and consumer electronics.  Results
                  show that at distances of 1-2m, consumer electronic
                  devices containing microphones are vulnerable to the
                  injection of bogus audio signals.  Our measurements
                  show that in free air, intentional EMI under 10W can
                  inhibit pacing and induce defibrillation shocks at
                  distances up to 1-2m on implantable cardiac
                  electronic devices.  However, with the sensing leads
                  and medical devices immersed in a saline bath to
                  better approximate the human body, the same
                  experiment decreased to under 5cm.  Our defenses
                  range from prevention with simple analog shielding
                  to detection with a signal contamination metric
                  based on the root mean square of waveform
                  amplitudes.  Our contribution to securing cardiac
                  devices includes a novel defense mechanism that
                  probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent with
                  the refractory period of cardiac tissue.}
