  abstract = {To head-off the trend of increasing power con- sumption and throughput overheads due to refresh in DRAM, researchers are exploring ways to fine-tune refresh rate. Refresh management proposals range from temperature-aware refresh to partitioning data cells based on volatility, with each partition having its own refresh rate. One hurdle in this area is the lack of precise description of the evaluation setups used in current proposals. The incomplete descrip- tion makes it difficult to reproduce reproduce results and compare approaches. Thus, it is common for researchers to evaluate their approach using mathe- matical models derived on the experimental results from a disparate set of platforms.
To aide in the evaluation of existing and future ap- proaches for tuning DRAM refresh to save power, this paper provides a reproducible DRAM research plat- form. On this platform, we re-run commonly cited experiments from previous papers in the area. Our experimental results highlight the necessity of a re- producible platform by showing how both assump- tions and experimental outcomes are sensitive to of- ten omitted parameters like temperature and refresh duration.
