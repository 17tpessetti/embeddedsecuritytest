  abstract = {Computers plugged into power outlets leak identifiable information
	by drawing variable amounts of power when performing different tasks. This
	work examines the extent to which this side channel leaks private information
	about web browsing to an observer taking measurements at the power outlet.
	Using direct measurements of AC power consumption with an instrumented outlet,
	we construct a classifier that correctly identifies unlabeled power traces of
	webpage activity from a set of 51 candidates with 99% precision and 99%
	recall.  The classifier rejects samples of $441$ pages outside the corpus with
	a false-positive rate of less than 2%.  It is also robust to a number of
	variations in webpage loading conditions, including encryption.  When trained
	on power traces from two computers loading the same webpage, the classifier
	correctly labels further traces of that webpage from either computer.  We
	identify several reasons for this consistently recognizable power consumption,
	including system calls, and propose countermeasures to limit the leakage of
	private information.  Characterizing the AC power side channel may help lead
	to practical countermeasures that protect user privacy from an untrustworthy
	power infrastructure.},
